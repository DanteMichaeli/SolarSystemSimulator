/* BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CORRECTLY FORMATTED PLANET FILE
/* THE FIRST LINE IS THE RUNTIME OF THE SIMULATION IN SECONDS
/* THE SECOND LINE IS THE TIME STEP ADJUSTMENT. THE NUMBER REPRESENTS HOW MANY "REAL LIFE DAYS" ARE REPRESENTED BY ONE SECOND OF SIMULATION TIME
/* THE THIRD LINE IS A SUN OBJECT. THE PARAMETERS ARE NAME, MASS, X POSITION, Y POSITION. AND COLOR, SINCE THE SUN IS THE CENTER OF THE SYSTEM, IT'S VELOCITY IS ALWAYS 0
/* THE NEXT LINES ARE PLANET OBJECTS. THE PARAMETERS ARE NAME, MASS, X POSITION, Y POSITION, X VELOCITY, Y VELOCITY, AND COLOR

/* !! RADII AND MASSES MUST BE POSITIVE !!
/* !! X AND Y POSITIONS MUST BE NON-NEGATIVE !!
/* !! NO SPACES SHOULD BE PRESENT IN THE FILE EXCEPT FOR AFTER THE COMMAS !!
