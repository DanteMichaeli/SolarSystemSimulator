4.3.2023 report 1:
The basic structure of the program has been mostly defined, but will be slightly modified in the future for clarity.
The most important functions for updating celestial body positions and velocities exist, as well as the celestialBody abstract class.
No tests have been done yet, since a simple GUI hasn't been built yet. Methods will also be implemented using a vector class instead of X and Y values separately.
I am about 1 week behind in schedule time, due to a heavy courseload this period. Will try to catch up ASAP.
