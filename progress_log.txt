4.3.2023 report 1:
The basic structure of the program has been mostly defined, but will be slightly modified in the future for clarity.
The most important functions for updating celestial body positions and velocities exist, as well as the celestialBody abstract class.
No tests have been done yet, since a simple GUI hasn't been built yet. Methods will also be implemented using a vector class instead of X and Y values separately.
I am about 1 week behind in schedule time, due to a heavy courseload this period. Will try to catch up ASAP.

19.3.2023 report 2:
I have managed to Æ’amiliarize myself a bit more with ScalaFX.
I have managed to successfully create and display the first frame of a simulation, where the planets have been instantiated from a properly formatted text file.
I am trying rn to create an update method that would progress the simulation forward, but to no avail...
O2 has taken a lot of my time, so I am a bit behind schedule. I will try to catch up.
